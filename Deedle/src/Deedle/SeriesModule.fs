/// The `Series` module provides an F#-friendly API for working with data and time series. 
/// The API follows the usual design for collection-processing in F#, so the functions work
/// well with the pipelining (`|>`) operator. For example, given a series with ages,
/// we can use `Series.filterValues` to filter outliers and then `Stats.mean` to calculate
/// the mean:
///
///     ages
///     |> Series.filterValues (fun v -> v > 0.0 && v < 120.0)
///     |> Stats.mean
///
/// The module provides comprehensive set of functions for working with series. The same
/// API is also exposed using C#-friendly extension methods. In C#, the above snippet could
/// be written as:
///
///     [lang=csharp]
///     ages
///       .Where(kvp => kvp.Value > 0.0 && kvp.Value < 120.0)
///       .Mean()
/// 
/// For more information about similar frame-manipulation functions, see the `Frame` module.
/// For more information about C#-friendly extensions, see `SeriesExtensions`. The functions 
/// in the `Series` module are grouped in a number of categories and documented below.
///
/// Accessing series data and lookup
/// --------------------------------
///
/// Functions in this category provide access to the values in the series.
///
///  - The term _observation_ is used for a key value pair in the series. 
///  - When working with a sorted series, it is possible to perform lookup using
///    keys that are not present in the series - you can specify to search for the
///    previous or next available value using _lookup behavior_.
///  - Functions such as `get` and `getAll` have their counterparts `lookup` and
///    `lookupAll` that let you specify lookup behavior.
///  - For most of the functions that may fail, there is a `try[Foo]` variant that
///    returns `None` instead of failing.
///  - Functions with a name ending with `At` perform lookup based on the absolute
///    integer offset (and ignore the keys of the series)
///
/// Series transformations 
/// ----------------------
///
/// Functions in this category perform standard transformations on series including
/// projections, filtering, taking some sub-series of the series, aggregating values
/// using scanning and so on.
///
/// Projection and filtering functions generally skip over missing values, but there
/// are variants `filterAll` and `mapAll` that let you handle missing values explicitly.
/// Keys can be transformed using `mapKeys`. When you do not need to consider the keys,
/// and only care about values, use `filterValues` and `mapValues` (which is also aliased
/// as the `$` operator). 
///
/// Series supports standard set of folding functions including `reduce` and `fold` (to
/// reduce series values into a single value) as well as the `scan[All]` function, which 
/// can be used to fold values of a series into a series of intermeidate folding results.
///
/// The functions `take[Last]` and `skip[Last]` can be used to take a sub-series of the
/// original source series by skipping a specified number of elements. Note that this 
/// does not require an ordered series and it ignores the index - for index-based lookup
/// use slicing, such as `series.[lo .. hi]`, instead.
///
/// Finally the `shift` function can be used to obtain a series with values shifted by 
/// the specified offset. This can be used e.g. to get previous value for each key using
/// `Series.shift 1 ts`. The `diff` function calculates difference from previous value using
/// `ts - (Series.shift offs ts)`.
///
/// Processing series with exceptions
/// ---------------------------------
/// 
/// The functions in this group can be used to write computations over series that may fail.
/// They use the type `tryval<'T>` which is defined as a discriminated union:
///
///     type tryval<'T> = 
///       | Success of 'T
///       | Error of exn
///
/// The function `tryMap` lets you create `Series<'K, tryval<'T>>` by mapping over values
/// of an original series. You can then extract values using `tryValues`, which throws 
/// `AggregateException` if there were any errors. Functions `tryErrors` and `trySuccesses`
/// give series containing only errors and successes. You can fill failed values with
/// a constant using `fillErrorsWith`.
/// 
/// Hierarchical index operations
/// -----------------------------
///
/// When the key of a series is tuple, the elements of the tuple can be treated
/// as multiple levels of a index. For example `Series<'K1 * 'K2, 'V>` has two 
/// levels with keys of types `'K1` and `'K2` respectively.
///
/// The functions in this cateogry provide a way for aggregating values in the 
/// series at one of the levels. For example, given a series `input` indexed by
/// two-element tuple, you can calculate mean for different first-level values as
/// follows:
///
///     input |> applyLevel fst Stats.mean
///
/// Note that the `Stats` module provides helpers for typical statistical operations,
/// so the above could be written just as `input |> Stats.levelMean fst`.
/// 
/// Grouping, windowing and chunking
/// --------------------------------
///
/// This category includes functions that group data from a series in some way. Two key
/// concepts here are _window_ and _chunk_. Window refers to (overlapping) sliding windows
/// over the input series while chunk refers to non-overlapping blocks of the series.
///
/// The boundary behavior can be specified using the `Boundary` flags. The value 
/// `Skip` means that boundaries (incomplete windows or chunks) should be skipped. The value
/// `AtBeginning` and `AtEnding` can be used to define at which side should the boundary be
/// returned (or skipped). For chunking, `AtBeginning ||| Skip` makes sense and it means that
/// the incomplete chunk at the beginning should be skipped (aligning the last chunk with the end).
///
/// The behavior may be specified in a number of ways (which is reflected in the name):
///  - `dist` - using an absolute distance between the keys
///  - `while` - using a condition on the first and last key
///  - `size` - by specifying the absolute size of the window/chunk
///
/// The functions ending with `Into` take a function to be applied to the window/chunk. 
/// The functions `window`, `windowInto` and `chunk`, `chunkInto` are simplified versions
/// that take a size. There is also `pairwise` function for sliding window of size two.
///
/// Missing values
/// --------------
///
/// This group of functions provides a way of working with missing values in a series.
/// The `dropMissing` function drops all keys for which there are no values in the series.
/// The `withMissingFrom` function lets you copy missing values from another series.
/// The remaining functions provide different mechanism for filling the missing values.
///
///  * `fillMissingWith` fills missing values with a specified constant
///  * `fillMissingUsing` calls a specified function for every missing value
///  * `fillMissing` and variants propagates values from previous/later keys
///
/// Sorting and index manipulation
/// ------------------------------
/// 
/// A series that is sorted by keys allows a number of additional operations (such as lookup
/// using the `Lookp.ExactOrSmaller` lookup behavior). However, it is also possible to sort 
/// series based on the values - although the functions for manipulation with series do not
/// guarantee that the order will be preserved.
///
/// To sort series by keys, use `sortByKey`. Other sorting functions let you sort the series
/// using a specified comparer function (`sortWith`), using a projection function (`sortBy`)
/// and using the default comparison (`sort`).
///
/// In addition, you can also replace the keys of a series with other keys using `indexWith` 
/// or with integers using `indexOrdinally`. To pick and reorder series values using to match
/// a list of keys use `realign`.
///
/// Sampling, resampling and advanced lookup
/// ----------------------------------------
///
/// Given a (typically) time series sampling or resampling makes it possible to 
/// get time series with representative values at lower or uniform frequency.
/// We use the following terminology:
///
///  - `lookup` and `sample` functions find values at specified key; if a key is not
///    available, they can look for value associated with the nearest smaller or 
///    the nearest greater key.
/// 
///  - `resample` function aggregate values values into chunks based
///    on a specified collection of keys (e.g. explicitly provided times), or 
///    based on some relation between keys (e.g. date times having the same date).
/// 
///  - `resampleUniform` is similar to resampling, but we specify keys by
///    providing functions that generate a uniform sequence of keys (e.g. days),
///    the operation also fills value for days that have no corresponding 
///    observations in the input sequence.
///
/// Joining, merging and zipping
/// ----------------------------
///
/// Given two series, there are two ways to combine the values. If the keys in the series
/// are not overlapping (or you want to throw away values from one or the other series), 
/// then you can use `merge` or `mergeUsing`. To merge more than 2 series efficiently, use 
/// the `mergeAll` function, which has been optimized for large number of series.
///
/// If you want to align two series, you can use the _zipping_ operation. This aligns
/// two series based on their keys and gives you tuples of values. The default behavior
/// (`zip`) uses outer join and exact matching. For ordered series, you can specify 
/// other forms of key lookups (e.g. find the greatest smaller key) using `zipAlign`.
/// functions ending with `Into` are generally easier to use as they call a specified
/// function to turn the tuple (of possibly missing values) into a new value.
///
/// For more complicated behaviors, it is often convenient to use joins on frames instead
/// of working with series. Create two frames with single columns and then use the join
/// operation. The result will be a frame with two columns (which is easier to use than
/// series of tuples).

  /// 
  /// ## Parameters
  ///  - `series` - An input series to be resampled
  ///  - `interval` - The interval between the individual samples 
  ///  - `dir` - Specifies how the keys should be generated. `Direction.Forward` means that the 
  ///    key is the smallest value of each chunk (and so first key of the series is returned and 
  ///    the last is not, unless it matches exactly _start + k*interval_); `Direction.Backward`
  ///    means that the first key is skipped and sample is generated at, or just before the end 
  ///    of interval and at the end of the series.
  ///  - `lookup` - Specifies how the lookup based on keys is performed. `Exact` means that the
  ///    values at exact keys will be returned; `NearestGreater` returns the nearest greater key value
  ///    (starting at the first key) and `NearestSmaller` returns the nearest smaller key value
  ///    (starting at most `interval` after the end of the series)
