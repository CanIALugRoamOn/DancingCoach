# DancingTrainer

The Kinect v2 is used to capture the user and the data is used to give feedback e.g. the recogntion of basic dance steps.
Therefore, the [Kinect SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561) is needed.
The interfaces can be used to add other dance styles to the Dancing Trainer.
To build gestures that might be used to recognize characteristics of a dance style you can follow this [tutorial](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/k4wdev/Custom-Gestures-End-to-End-with-Kinect-and-Visual-Gesture-Builder).
